      1. Frame by Frame Animation There are times when we need an animation that
      is quite difficult to achieve with raw CSS transition properties on
      elements. For example, a progress indicator or a moving icon can be a
      difficult task to achieve with raw CSS properties. In such cases,
      image-based frame-by-frame animation is a perfect choice where you can
      achieve all types of challenging tasks flexibly. Note: We can also use
      GIFs for most cases, but there are certain limitations to using GIFs. They
      are limited to 256 color palettes and also they canâ€™t have alpha
      transparency which becomes a big problem when there are items underneath
      the GIF. GIFs are great for portable tasks, but not a recommended choice
      for experimentation.
